# UE4 environment with infrustructure to record player input for ANN training

Still in development... have a look at https://github.com/alicepearse/UE4BaseGameANN for a similar infrustructure that has been completed.

##### Requirements

- UE 4.23
- tensorflow-ue4 plugin v0.14.0 for UE4.23 from getnamo (https://github.com/getnamo/tensorflow-ue4/releases/tag/0.14.0)
- TensorFlow 1.15
- Python 3.5â€“3.8

###### Bugs
- I have included a basic AI controller, however, if you include an AI controller in the game the recording data nodes will no longer work. I am currently addressing this issue.
